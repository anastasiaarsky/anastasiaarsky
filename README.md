## Hey there, I'm Anastasia Arsky! 😊

### 🌲 About Me

I'm a recent Cal Poly San Luis Obispo graduate with a B.S. in Statistics, currently based in Redwood City, CA (SF Bay Area). An outdoor enthusiast, you can catch me hiking, skiing, rock climbing, or just hammocking. I'm also an unabashed music lover - apologies in advance for your eardrums!

### 🚀 My Journey 

While completing my statistics degree, I enrolled in some computer science courses and was surprised to realize that 
I quite enjoyed the flexibility and creativity that programming offered me. It contrasted greatly with the rigidity of the assumptions and mathematical theories that are the foundation of statistics. My curiosity for both domains led me to discover the exciting world of data science and machine learning - where the precision of statistics meets the versatility of programming!

### 📚 Current Endeavors

On the path to becoming a Machine Learning Engineer/Data Scientist, I'm expanding my skill set through a combination of self-learning, online courses, and an MLE Bootcamp through San Diego Extended Studies. Please check out my [Machine Learning Capstone](https://github.com/anastasiaarsky/ML-Capstone-Spam-Classification), centered around email spam classification, to see the proficiency and insights I've gained from the MLE Bootcamp! 

### 👩‍💻 Future Plans

Anticipating the end of my MLE bootcamp (expected by 9/10/23), I'm gearing up to immerse myself in the machine learning/data science realm. Leveraging my statistical foundation with my newly acquired machine learning skills, I'm excited to tackle complex data-driven problems, particularly those involving NLP.
